#### Instructions:
This master branch is just for safekeeping and has finished code from the tutorial. If you want to learn how to build an API, switch to one of the following branches:

1. setting-up-rails-api
2. unit-testing-models-and-bottles
3. creating-api
4. testing-api
5. serialize-dat-suya

The above is also the recommended order of the tutorial. Please start from the branch setting-up-rails-api if you are a Rails beginner. Do that by switching to the branch in the dropdown menu on Github and following the instructions in the README.md
